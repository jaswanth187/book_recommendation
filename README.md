# book_recommendation

There are four types of recommendation systems

	1,Popularity based
		->It recommends most popular item or content in that platform(ex:- youtube:trending videos)

	2,Content based
		->Similar content based recommendation system (ios phone - ios earphones)

	3,Collaboartion filtering based
		-> In this type of recommendation system, we donâ€™t use the features of the item to recommend it, rather we classify the users into the clusters of similar 
		   types, and recommend each user according to the preference of its cluster. 

	4,hybrid recommendation system
		->This is the combination of all the above systems.
    
    
    In this project we are using Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender system.
